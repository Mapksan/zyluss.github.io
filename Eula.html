<ul>Ahh, EULA, minecraft's big issue:</ul>

In the trolling and bullying towards: gender, homophobia and age I support it.
People may be saying "ahh dammit minecraft servers are ruined!" Maybe, they could well be ruined
but if your enjoying bullying people and 'trolling' people then that's pretty messed up, 'LOL kids crying on the internet 
Is HILARIOUS though!' I say put yourself in that position, your possibly young and your parents have just bought you this cool new game all your friends are talking about, you decided to join a server and try to learn how to play, once you have got a decent base setup this 'awesome youtuber' comes along and decides to have some 'fun' with you by spawning hostile mobs upon you thus blowing up your house ect. After this the youtuber is finished with you he 'fixes' your house, by 'fixing' they
actually mean to be lazy and do //regen (A worldedit command to regenerate the area completely, with no prior buildings). The player the gets annoyed, possibly causing chaos and possibly crying, This isn't the correct way to run a server. Thus ruining a potentially amazing player that will contribute to the community, That is how minecraft thrives.
